# PLAsTiCC-Challenge-
Astroinformatics exam project

This project regards the astroinformatics exam for my master degree in Data Science. The project has been worked in team and the goal of work was to classify light curves, from simulated data of the LSST (Large Survey Synoptic Telescope) retrieved from the kaggle challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/c/PLAsTiCC-2018

The repo contains a zip folder with the following files: 
- Documentation of the project: Data_mining_and_astroinformatics_project-3(compressor).pdf
- data_note.pdf --> documentation of the plasticc challenge 
- Light Curves Project.ipynb --> the notebook of the project, the notebook needs to work with the following python scripts: 
    - Modelling.py
    - Preprocessing.py


If you decide to reproduce our work, be aware to download the dataset from the kaggle link. Here, the dasetes has not been uploaded beacuse they are too heavy.


Enjoy -
